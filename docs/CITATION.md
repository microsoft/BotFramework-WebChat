# Citation

This document describes how citation works in Web Chat.

## Background

Adding citation in a message helps customers better understand the response.

Web Chat added citation support since [4.16.0](../CHANGELOG.md#4160---2023-11-16).

## Terminology

### Markdown reference style link

A type of link in Markdown that is located below the paragraph. It would reduce repetitiveness when multiple words shared the same link and improve readability.

### Sensitivity label

Additional metadata can be added to indicate how the content of the link should be used.

## Bot implementation

Bot developers would need to implement the citation as outlined in this section. The implementation below will enable livestreaming to both Azure Bot Services and Teams.

## Non-URL citation

Citation which does not have a link to point the user to. But part or whole of the cited content is attached in the activity.

### Activity text

-  It must be in Markdown format
-  It must use reference style link

#### Sample payload

Notes:

-  The third citation is a non-URL citation, its link `cite:1` is currently ignored

```md
Sure, you should override the default proxy settings[1]â€‹[2], when your proxy server requires authentication[3].

```

### Message object

![Direct Line activity graph](../media/direct-line-activity-graph.png)

Please refer to the graph for details of each fields. Notably:

-  Only nested objects are supported (a.k.a. "compact form"), flattened/referenced objects are not supported unless stated otherwise
-  Subclasses are not supported. If the object is expected to be `Message`, it must not be `EmailMessage` (subclass)
