This repository contains code for the Bot Framework Web Chat component. The Bot Framework Web Chat component is a highly-customizable web-based client for the Bot Framework V4 SDK. The Bot Framework SDK v4 enable developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications.

This repo is part of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework) - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

## Migrating from Web Chat v3 to v4

There are three possible paths that migration might take when migrating from v3 to v4. First, please compare your beginning scenario:

### My current website integrates Web Chat using an `<iframe>` element obtained from Azure Bot Services. I want to upgrade to v4.

Starting from May 2019, we are rolling out v4 to websites that integrate Web Chat using `<iframe>` element. Please refer to [the embed documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/packages/embed) for information on integrating Web Chat using `<iframe>`.

### My website is integrated with Web Chat v3 and uses customization options provided by Web Chat, no customization at all, or very little of my own customization that was not available with Web Chat.

Please follow the implementation of sample [`01.c.getting-started-migration`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.c.getting-started-migration) to convert your webpage from v3 to v4 of Web Chat.

### My website is integrated with a fork of Web Chat v3. I have implemented a lot of customization in my version of Web Chat, and I am concerned v4 is not compatible with my needs.

One of our team's favorite things about v4 of Web Chat is the ability to add customization **without the need to fork Web Chat**. Although this creates additional overhead for v3 users who forked Web Chat previously, we will do our best to support customers making the bump. Please use the following suggestions:

-  Take a look at the implementation of sample [`01.c.getting-started-migration`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.c.getting-started-migration). This is a great starting place to get Web Chat up and running.
-  Next, please go through the [samples list](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples) to compare your customization requirements to what Web Chat has already provided support for. These samples are made up of commonly asked-for features for Web Chat.
-  If one or more of your features is not available in the samples, please look through our [open and closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+), [Samples label](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ASample), and the [Migration Support label](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+migrate+label%3A%22Migration+Support%22) to search for sample requests and/or customization support for a feature you are looking for. Adding your comment to open issues will help the team prioritize requests that are in high demand, and we encourage participation in our community.
-  If you did not find your feature in the list of open requests, please feel free to [file your own request](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/new). Just like the item above, other customers adding comments to your open issue will help us prioritize which features are most commonly needed across Web Chat users.
-  Finally, if you need your feature as soon as possible, we welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/compare) to Web Chat. If you have the coding experience to implement the feature yourself, we would very much appreciate the additional support! Creating the feature yourself will mean that it is available for your use on Web Chat more quickly, and that other customers looking for the same or similar feature may utilize your contribution.
-  Make sure to check out the rest of this `README` to learn more about v4.

# How to use

> For previous versions of Web Chat (v3), visit the [Web Chat v3 branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/v3).

First, create a bot using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
Once the bot is created, you will need to [obtain the bot's Web Chat secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-webchat?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#step-1) in Azure Portal. Then use the secret to [generate a token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and pass it to your Web Chat.

Here is how how you can add Web Chat control to your website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
      <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js"></script>
      <script>
         window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
            {
               directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({
                  token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN'
               }),
               userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
               username: 'Web Chat User',
               locale: 'en-US',
               botAvatarInitials: 'WC',
               userAvatarInitials: 'WW'
            },
            document.getElementById('webchat')
         );
      </script>
   </body>
</html>
```

> `userID`, `username`, `locale`, `botAvatarInitials`, and `userAvatarInitials` are all optional parameters to pass into the `renderWebChat` method. To learn more about Web Chat props, look at the [Web Chat API Reference](#web-chat-api-reference) section of this `README`.

## Integrate with JavaScript

Web Chat is designed to integrate with your existing website using JavaScript or React. Integrating with JavaScript will give you moderate styling and customizability.

You can use the full, typical webchat package that contains the most typically used features.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
      <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js"></script>
      <script>
         window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
            {
               directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({
                  token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN'
               }),
               userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID'
            },
            document.getElementById('webchat')
         );
      </script>
   </body>
</html>
```

See the working sample of the [full Web Chat bundle](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.a.getting-started-full-bundle).

## Integrate with React

For full customizability, you can use React to recompose components of Web Chat.

To install the production build from NPM, run `npm install botframework-webchat`.

```jsx
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';
import React from 'react';
import ReactWebChat from 'botframework-webchat';

export default class extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.directLine = new DirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ReactWebChat directLine={ this.directLine } userID='YOUR_USER_ID' />
      element
    );
  }
}
```

> You can also run `npm install botframework-webchat@master` to install a development build that is synced with Web Chat's GitHub `master` branch.

See a working sample of [Web Chat rendered via React](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/03.a.host-with-react/).

# Customize Web Chat UI

Web Chat is designed to be customizable without forking the source code. The table below outlines what kind of customizations you can achieve when you are importing Web Chat in different ways. This list is not exhaustive.

| `styleOptions`             | Object that stores customization values for your styling of Web Chat. For the complete list of (frequently updated) default style options, please see the [defaultStyleSetOptions.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/packages/component/src/Styles/defaultStyleSetOptions.js) file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `styleSet`                 | The non-recommended way of overriding styles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `userID`                   | Specify a userID. There are two ways to specify the `userID`: in props, or in the token when generating the token call (`createDirectLine()`). If both methods are used to specify the userID, the token userID property will be used, and a `console.warn` will appear during runtime. If the `userID` is provided via props but is prefixed with `'dl'`, e.g. `'dl_1234'`, the value will be thrown and a new `ID` generated. If `userID` is not specified, it will default to a random user ID. Multiple users sharing the same user ID is not recommended; their user state will be shared. |
| `username`                 | Specify a username.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `webSpeechPonyFillFactory` | Specify the Web Speech object for text-to-speech and speech-to-text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
