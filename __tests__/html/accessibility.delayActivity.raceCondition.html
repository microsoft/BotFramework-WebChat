      // This test is to make sure we don't regress issue #3431, a race condition:

      // - After created a conversation
      // - User send an activity (or Web Chat programmatically sending out an activity)
      // - At the same time, the bot also send another activity, with reply to ID of a bogus activity

      // The timeout occurs if the user's message was send before the bot message was received.

      // Originally, we allow the bot's activity to show up even they point to a bogus activity, if that message was the very first activity in the transcript.

      // Because the user's activity was already in the transcript, the relaxation was not granted. Thus, the bot's activity is subject to "reply to ID" and a timeout.
