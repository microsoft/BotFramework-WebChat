// - "conversationUpdate" activity is never sent to Web Chat, thus, it is not defined

        // The newer "webchat:send-status" is slightly different than the previous "state".
        // The difference is: the newer "webchat:send-status" use a hardcoded 5 minutes timeout, instead of user-defined timeout.
        // We assume web developers will not set a timeout value longer than 5 minutes.
        //
        // The older one use a user-defined timeout, which could be a small number (say, 5s).
        // At t=6s after a message is being sent, the message will be marked as "send failed" and the saga which "wait/listen to delivery status" will stop.
        // Changing `styleOptions.sendTimeout` to 20s will not "revive" the message back to "sending" because the saga has already stopped.
        // Thus, in our old code, we could not make the `state` field useful because it lacks "revivability". Thus, we simply ignored it.
        // As the saga had already stopped, changing `styleOptions.sendTimeout` will not "revive" the message back to "sending."
        // Not able to "revive" the message equally means our React props cannot be changed on-the-fly.
        //
        // The downside of not using `state` field means, if the activity fail immediately or fatally (e.g. network error),
        // the UI will not change to "Send failed" until the specified timeout has passed.
        //
        // With the newer "webchat:send-status" field, the "send failed" state could means:
        // - More than 5 minutes had passed while sending the activity;
        // - Platform returned error (say HTTP 4xx/5xx or network error).
        //
        // UI should use `styleOptions.sendTimeout` with the `activity.localTimestamp` field to determines if the
        // activity is visually timed out or not. And UI should expect `styleOptions` could change at any time.
        //
        // The 5 minutes timeout is currently hardcoded and should be large enough to support user-defined timeouts.
        // As Redux Saga use stack/heap to keep track of waits and this could be expensive, the 5 minutes timeout will GC the waits.
        // The hardcoded timeout value can be easily increased with the cost of memory.
        //
        // In the future:
        //
        // -  If we move to other business logic library that offer lower costs, we could hardcode the timeout to Infinity.
        // -  This flag is set by Web Chat. We should move this flag to somewhere internal and not modifiable/overrideable by chat adapter developers.
